NOTES
=====

Design and implementation notes just to help keep everything straight in my
head while I'm working.


General
-------
* Each subsystem is responsible for loading and managing its resources, so
  other systems don't, for e.g., load sprites or sound effects directly
  themselves, they just tell the appropriate system that they want a particular
  file to be available in the future. So the renderer will allocate and manage
  sprites and maps etc., the audio system will load and manage SFX and music,
  and Entities will just keep handles to sprites and SFX and submit them at
  the appropriate time each frame.

  Entity has a spritesheet -> tells renderer to precache file -> renderer loads
  and manages the file data -> Entity gets a handle to it -> Entity submits
  render command with the given sprite handle.



Renderer
--------
* Keeps a cache of loaded spritesheets (etc.) and hands out handles to other
  systems that want to use them.


Map
---
* Map module is responsible for loading map files and providing a struct
  the renderer can use. This DOES NOT include the tilesheets for the maps,
  the cache manages those too.
* World query functions are also defined here.

Viewport
--------
* Basically manages a rectangle which represents the current viewport as it is
  panned around the map. The renderer uses it to decide what needs to be
  rendered each frame; render commands which fall outside of the viewport are
  discarded.

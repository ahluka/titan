 *	A library for working with a sprite definition format I'm working on.
 *	The basic idea is being able to specify arbitrary data--mostly 2D
 *	vectors--within each frame of a sprite. (Other data could be specified
 *	as well.) The point of this being frame-by-frame collision detection
 *	for attack animations, etc.
